### **How It Works:**  
1. **Game Starts** – The game flashes a random color.  
2. **Player's Turn** – The player must click the colors in the same order as shown.  
3. **Sequence Increases** – If the player gets it right, the game adds another color to the sequence.  
4. **Game Over** – If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and they must restart.
