# **Simon Says game**

The **Simon Says game** is a classic memory-based game where players must repeat a sequence of colors or sounds in the correct order. The sequence increases in length with each round, making the game progressively more challenging.

### **How It Works:**  
1. **Game Starts** â€“ The game flashes a random color.  
2. **Player's Turn** â€“ The player must click the colors in the same order as shown.  
3. **Sequence Increases** â€“ If the player gets it right, the game adds another color to the sequence.  
4. **Game Over** â€“ If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and they must restart.

### **Main Features:**  
âœ… **Randomized Sequences** â€“ Each round, a new color is added to the sequence.  
âœ… **Audio & Visual Feedback** â€“ Flashing lights and sounds help players memorize the pattern.  
âœ… **Increasing Difficulty** â€“ The sequence gets longer after every correct attempt.  
âœ… **Game Over Detection** â€“ The game resets when a mistake is made.  
âœ… **High Score Tracking (Optional)** â€“ Keeps track of the longest sequence achieved.

### **Technologies Used (if coded in JavaScript):**  
- **HTML** â€“ For the game layout (buttons, score display).  
- **CSS** â€“ For styling and animations.  
- **JavaScript** â€“ To handle game logic, user input, and sequence generation.
